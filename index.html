                <p class="paragraph"> Guns can be used to self-defense aganist assault this would scare most of the people that are trying to rob you but this can cause a huge problem so owning a guns is really dangerous because this could put you in a bad shape in the eyes of the law. if you suffered from a mental issue and shot someone and he dies this would affect your criminal record and this will affect your chances to get a better life </p>

                <h2 class="myDIV">Cons of owning a gun </h2>

                <p class="paragraph"> theres a lot of accidents in history that where cause by a gunshot like the death of Abrahamn Lilncon "first president of the US" ,Selena Quintanilla "famous spanish singer", etc... The mind/brain of a human can be easily manipulate by the primal instinct of survival or can be manipulate by another person because when we are scared our brain will not detect the lies or truth because all that the brain is think is to survive.</p>

                <h2 class="in"> In conclusion</h2>

                <p class="paragraph"> theres a lot of advantage and disadvantage so in my opinion we need to make more diffuclut the access to guns to be able to reduce the percentage of death,suicede etc... </p>
